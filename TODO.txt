#####  LEXER  #####
* Support _ in numbers for clarity

- Number to support float (period)
- Support numbers of differnt precision
- Handle line comments
- We need a way to know what line, column we're parsing when there is an error
- Lexer.cpp needs a way to handle errors and print to screen
- Handle String type
- Handle multiline comments

- Create Basic AST hierarchy
- Be able to parse variable declaration
- Be able to parse functions
- Be able to parse blocks
- Be able to parse assignments
- Be able to parse Math expressions
- Print AST on the screen
