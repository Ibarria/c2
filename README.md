Introduction
============

This code is an effort to write a compiler for a new programming language. I am drawing inspiration from JAI from Jonathan Blow, a bit from Go, and a bit from Swift.

This language does not have a name yet, I have toyed with `c2` , `jai`, `jet`.

The language is statically typed, with option to runtime information and compile time execution. In the future the language will compile to LLVM, but for now it compiles to C.
